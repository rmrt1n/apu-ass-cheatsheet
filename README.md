# My APU Assignments Source Code

This repo is an archive of some of the coding assignments from my CS(DA) degree 
at Asia Pacific University (APU). One of the biggest challenges for these types
of assignments is not knowing where/how to start. This repo aims to share some
reference or sample code to help you get started.

You're free to copy any code here. I might have left some personal identifiers
here, so **MAKE SURE TO REMOVE THEM** if you find any. If you encounter an issue
or have a question regarding the code, feel free to 
[open an issue](https://github.com/rmrt1n/apu-ass-cheatsheet/issues/new).

## Modules
Below are the list of modules included in this repo. Each will contain the
assignment question (`question.pdf`), my submission (`submission.pdf`), a
README containing build instructions, and the program source code.
