# OODJ

This is a gradle project, so you should be able to import it to any IDE you
like. The GUI was built using Netbean's swing builder, and probably won't work
on other IDEs(?). There's no submission.pdf for this module because I can't
find it :/ I'll upload it if I happen to find it in the future.

**WARNING:** This was my first project in Java, and it works just fine. There is
however, a single bug that we (me & my group mate) missed during development and
now I don't even remember whether it's already fixed. So, if you're using this,
just remember to test the app again before the presentation.
