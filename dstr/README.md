# DSTR

See the README of ICP for the build instructions; They are nearly identical.
Credentials for the program are username: `p`, password: `p`. If you're looking
for reference code using idiomatic C++, this one might not be what you're
looking for. I prefer to just use C over C++ (granted that I haven't worked on 
any *real* systems program that would require the abstractions and features 
provided by C++).
